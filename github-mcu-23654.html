<h2>Sharks in 2019</h2>

<p>There are more than 500 species of sharks ranging in size from seven inches, the size of a human hand, to over 39 feet. And, according to scientists, more species are being discovered every year. Sharks play an important role in the ecosystem by keeping the oceans in balance. Unfortunately, the fear surrounding sharks creates a huge disservice to one of the most important animals on the planet.</p>

<h2>Conservation</h2>

<p>It’s estimated that between 63 and 273 million sharks are killed by fisheries each year. In an effort to save sharks, conservationists are working to ban shark finning and the trade of shark fins.</p><br>

    <p>The inhumane practice of shark finning involves catching sharks and removing their fins (which are commercially valuable) while they are still alive and throwing the rest of the shark back into the ocean where they die a slow, agonizing death.</p><br>
    
    <p>In order to breathe, sharks must move. They need their fins to swim and without them, sink slowly to the ocean floor where they bleed to death and suffocate or are eaten alive by other predators. This is not only cruel, it’s wasteful with less than 10% of the weight of the animal used and more than 90% discarded, equating to 54 billion pounds of dead fish and animals per year that are brought out of the ocean, killed and then thrown back because they weren’t the target catch.</p> <br>
    
    <p>Tragically, shark fins are worth money and because of this, sharks are being fished. A single pound of fin can be worth more than $200. As of 2013, the economic value of sharks globally was estimated at $630 million per year. In contrast, at the time, shark ecotourism generated around $312 million annually worldwide and is predicted to reach $780 million within 20 years.</p><br>
